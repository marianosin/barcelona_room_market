# Barcelona room market

This is an end to end project to analyze long term room renting market in Barcelona.

This project will be divided in different sections:

1) Data extraction: This section will consist of building an automated process to extract data and save it as portable files (CSVs)

2) Data cleasing and transformation: In this section I will take the data generated in step 1 to clean, transform and organize in a more user friendly structure. The data will be modeled and stored in a databased powered by Postgres.

3) Data exploration: Using a Jupyter notebook the data will be explored and I will extrac statistical metrics to describe and understand what the data will be saying. Some KPIs will be created.

4) Visualization and presentation: Once the data is ready to be visualized, I will build a dashboard to analize data dynamically using visualization tools like metabase, Tableau or PowerBI
